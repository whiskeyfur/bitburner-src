          You can purchase augmentations for your Sleeves. These augmentations have the same effect as they would for
          you. You can only purchase augmentations that you unlocked through factions. If an augmentation is useless for
          Sleeves, it will not be available. Sleeves can install an augmentation without its prerequisites.

          <br />
          When purchasing an augmentation for a Sleeve, it is immediately installed. This means that the Sleeve will
          immediately lose all of its stat experience.
