## NS.nuke() method

Runs NUKE.exe on a server.

**Signature:**

```typescript
nuke(host: string): boolean;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  host | string | Hostname of the target server. |

**Returns:**

boolean

True if the player runs the program successfully, and false otherwise.

## Remarks

RAM cost: 0.05 GB

Running NUKE.exe on a target server gives you root access which means you can execute scripts on said server. NUKE.exe must exist on your home computer.

Each server has a different number of required open ports. If that number is greater than 0, you have to open its ports before nuking it. You can check the requirement with [getServerNumPortsRequired](./bitburner.ns.getservernumportsrequired.md) or [getServer().numOpenPortsRequired](./bitburner.server.numopenportsrequired.md)<!-- -->.

Note that the server's required hacking level is not a requirement of nuking. You can nuke a server as long as you open enough ports, regardless of your hacking level.

## Example


```js
ns.nuke("foodnstuff");
```
