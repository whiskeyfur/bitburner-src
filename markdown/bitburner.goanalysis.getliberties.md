## GoAnalysis.getLiberties() method

Returns a number for each point, representing how many open nodes its network/chain is connected to. Empty nodes and dead nodes are shown as -1 liberties.

Takes an optional boardState argument; by default uses the current board state.

For example, a 5x5 board might look like this. The chain in the top-left touches 5 total empty nodes, and the one in the center touches four. The group in the bottom-right only has one liberty; it is in danger of being captured! <pre lang="javascript"> \[ \[-1, 5,-1,-1, 2\], \[ 5, 5,-1,-1,-1\], \[-1,-1, 4,-1,-1\], \[ 3,-1,-1, 3, 1\], \[ 3,-1,-1, 3, 1\], \] </pre>

**Signature:**

```typescript
getLiberties(boardState?: string[]): number[][];
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  boardState | string\[\] | _(Optional)_ Optional. The current board state, as an array of strings. Defaults to the current board state. |

**Returns:**

number\[\]\[\]

A 2D array of numbers counting the liberties of each point.

RAM cost: 16 GB (This is intentionally expensive; you can derive this info from just getBoardState() )
